$gutter-between-prices: 15px;

.price-pair {
    @include flex-center;
    flex-wrap: wrap;

    // We divide the gutter in half, and set the half as the margin on both sides of both prices.
    // This makes the 2 prices keep a horizontal distance between each other equal to "$gutter-between-prices".
    // If only one of them had a margin-right or -left equal to "$gutter-between-prices", then when they wrapped and stacked on top of each other, they wouldn't be vertically aligned as that one price would have a margin-right or -left.
    // So, this is why we're doing this. This is a common trick to solve a common problem in flexbox.
    // But in addition to that, this makes them keep a horizontal distance between themselves and the container (i.e. .price-pair)
    // To neutralize that, and compensate for it, we add negative margins on either side of the container to compensate for the left margin of the price on the left, and right margin of the price on the right.

    // Elements:
    &__before-discount {
        @include margin-x($gutter-between-prices / 2);
    }

    &__payable {
        @include margin-x($gutter-between-prices / 2);
    }

    @include margin-x(-$gutter-between-prices / 2);
}
